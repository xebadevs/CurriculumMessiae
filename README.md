## Context

This instance simulates a newly hired developer who is given the first task of creating a CV.

This CV must include, at least, the personal information of the chosen person, links, order lists, profile picture, styles, fonts, icons and, of course, features to make it more interesting and professional.

The lenguages to be used are restricted, in this first instance, to the basic ones: `HTML`, `CSS` and `JavaScript`. \
I also include `JQuery` to give HTML files a better file structure.

Fortunately, I am so busy with development work that I cannot spend more time on this development.

Lio Messi diserves, without a doubt, something much better.
Maybe I'll come back to this in the future to improve it.
